# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my CP1404 Practicals repository! This repository contains practical exercises for the CP1404 subject. It serves as a collection of my work throughout the course. 

## About Me
I am Ei Thin Zar Phyo, a student passionate about programming. I created this repository to track my progress in CP1404 and to showcase my clean code practices and problem-solving skills.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
Here are some of the main lessons I have learned about "clean code" in this subject:
- **Meaningful Variable Names:** I have learned the importance of using descriptive and meaningful variable names to enhance code readability.

- **Version Control:** Using version control systems like Git and GitHub is essential for collaborative development. It helps track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of the project.

- **Comments and Documentation:** Properly documenting code with comments and docstrings helps others understand its purpose and functionality.
