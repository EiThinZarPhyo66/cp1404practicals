# My Reflection for Programming 2 

In this reflection, I'll share my experiences and insights gained during the Programming 2 practicals, focusing on estimating tasks, code reviews, and practical tasks.

## Estimates for Practical Tasks


Throughout the course, I had the opportunity to estimate the time required for practical tasks. Initially, my accuracy was quite high, earning a 3 out of 4 rating on average. This was mainly because I felt like the initial practicals are continuation of the concepts covered in Programming 1.
However, as the subject advanced, the later practicals became challenging. However, I found that my accuracy improved steadily. This improvement can be attributed to a better understanding of my own work pace, practicing a lot and a growing familiarity with the types of challenges presented by the practical tasks. Reflecting on this, I would say that practice and experience played a significant role in enhancing my coding skills. 

## Code reviews

Participating in code reviews was an enlightening experience from two perspectives: being a reviewer and having my code reviewed.
When I reviewed others' code, I learned to analyze code more critically, identify potential issues, and offer constructive feedback. This process improved my ability to write clean and maintainable code as I internalized the best practices observed during reviews.
On the other hand, receiving feedback on my code was also enlightening. eviewers often pointed out alternative approaches, identified potential issues or vulnerabilities, and offered suggestions for improving code clarity and maintainability. This experience emphasized the importance of producing high-quality code and the benefits of collaborating with others in the development process. verall, code reviews taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement in developing my coding skills.

## Practical Tasks 

The practical tasks in this subject were generally well-structured, offering hands-on learning opportunities. However, if I were responsible for the subject, I would consider making a specific change to the class practicals. Instead of providing detailed step-by-step instructions, I would offer sample outputs for these tasks. I believe this approach would encourage students to engage more actively, foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter, and stimulate creativity in problem-solving.

### Two examples of PRs

Here are two examples of PRs that show me doing good code reviews.
